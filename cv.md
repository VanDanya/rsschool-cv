## **Code example**:
#### __Student's Final Grade KATA from CODEWARS:__
> #### *Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.*
> #### *This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);*
> #### *This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:*
> #### *100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.*
> #### *90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.*
> #### *75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.*
> #### *0, in other cases*


```
function finalGrade (exam, projects) {
  if(exam > 90 || projects > 10) return 100;
  if(exam > 75 & projects >= 5) return 90;
  if(exam > 50 & projects >= 2) return 75;
  return 0;
